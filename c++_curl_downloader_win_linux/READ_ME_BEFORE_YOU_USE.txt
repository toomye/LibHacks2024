Firstly: you must agree that by using this library we the DNS or anyone else at SFU will not be held responsible for anything downloaded with this library!

Second: This library requires libCURL to be installed on your system.
Most computers IE Linux and Window should have CURL by default, but I make no gurentees for Mac & BSD users.

Here is the Debian/Ubuntu CURL install command:
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
(you prob wont need it)
